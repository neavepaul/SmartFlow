# SmartFlow

SmartFlow is an innovative traffic control system leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL) to intelligently manage traffic signal timings and minimize congestion.

## Overview

Traffic congestion is a persistent issue impacting urban mobility and environmental sustainability. SmartFlow addresses this challenge by dynamically optimizing traffic signal timings using RL techniques. By integrating with SUMO, a traffic simulation tool, SmartFlow aims to alleviate traffic congestion at intersections.

## Need

Urban areas face increasing traffic congestion, leading to longer commute times, environmental pollution, and reduced fuel efficiency. Conventional traffic signal timings often fail to adapt to real-time traffic dynamics, exacerbating congestion issues. SmartFlow addresses this by employing AI-based signal control that learns and adapts to traffic conditions.

## Problem Solving

SmartFlow's core objective is to minimize traffic congestion and enhance traffic flow efficiency. By utilizing Reinforcement Learning algorithms, the system learns optimal signal timings by observing traffic patterns, aiming to reduce waiting times and enhance traffic throughput at intersections.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning Optimization:** Utilizes RL algorithms for adaptive traffic signal control.
- **Integration with SUMO:** Incorporates the SUMO traffic simulation tool for realistic traffic scenarios.
- **Distributed Training:** Leverages federated learning across Raspberry Pis for faster model training.
- **Dynamic Signal Control:** Adapts signal timings in real time based on traffic conditions.
- **Efficiency Improvement:** Aims to reduce congestion, waiting times, and overall travel durations.

## Federated Learning

SmartFlow employs a federated learning approach to train its models across multiple Raspberry Pis, enabling decentralized training without the need for centralizing data. Each Pi contributes to model training using local data generated from its own simulated traffic scenarios. This approach enhances scalability, privacy, and efficiency by avoiding data transfer and ensuring localized model updates.

Since the models are trained from slightly different simulations across diverse traffic scenarios, the resulting global model exhibits versatility and resilience. This versatility enables the model to adapt to various traffic conditions and scenarios, making it robust in handling real-world traffic complexities. SmartFlow's global model reflects a collective understanding derived from diverse local simulations, enhancing its adaptability in dynamic traffic environments.
